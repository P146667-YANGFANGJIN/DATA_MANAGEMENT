# World Bank GDP & Inflation Analysis (2000‚Äì2023)

This project analyzes global and regional economic indicators from 2000 to 2023 using World Bank data, with a focus on the relationship between GDP per capita and inflation across countries. Special emphasis is placed on ASEAN-10 comparisons and an in-depth case study of Malaysia.

---
## Project Objectives

This project aims to:

- Explore the global relationship between GDP per capita and inflation using multi-year data.
- Compare economic patterns among ASEAN-10 countries with visual indicators.
- Conduct a focused analysis of Malaysia's macroeconomic trends in terms of growth quality and price stability.

##  Chart Previews

### Chart 1 ‚Äì Global Scatter Plot: GDP vs Inflation (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 1](output/charts/Global_Scatter_Plot_2000-2023.png)

 This chart shows a moderate negative correlation (**Spearman œÅ ‚âà ‚Äì0.40**) between GDP per capita and inflation across countries. The trend is visible but weakened by large inflation volatility in low-income economies.

 
### Chart 2 ‚Äì World Map: GDP per Capita in 2023
![Chart 2](output/charts/GDP_per_Capita_in_2023.png)

 This choropleth map visualizes GDP per capita in 2023. North America, Western Europe, and parts of East Asia show high income levels, while Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia remain in the low-income range.  

*Map note: The world map is generated using Plotly's built-in geographic base (based on the [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) dataset) and visualized with 2023 GDP per capita data from the World Bank. The map is for data visualization purposes only and does not imply any political stance.*

 ***Note: This map is interactive. The image shown here is a static screenshot. To explore the zoomable and draggable version, please run the corresponding cell in the Notebook.***


### Chart 3 ‚Äì ASEAN-10: GDP per Capita (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 3](output/charts/ASEAN-10_GDP_per_Capita_2000‚Äì2023.png)

 This chart illustrates the per capita income growth of ASEAN-10 countries over two decades. Singapore and Brunei remain clear leaders, while Malaysia shows steady mid-to-high income progression.

### Chart 4 ‚Äì ASEAN-10: Inflation Rate (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 4](output/charts/ASEAN-10_Inflation_Rate_2000‚Äì2023.png)
 This chart shows inflation trends across ASEAN-10 countries. Singapore and Malaysia maintain low and stable rates, while Myanmar and Laos experience significant volatility.
 
### Chart 5 ‚Äì ASEAN-10 GDP per Capita Heatmap (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 5](output/charts/GDP_Heatmap.png)
 This heatmap illustrates GDP per capita growth across ASEAN-10. Darker cells indicate higher income levels. Malaysia is showing an upward trend.

### Chart 6 ‚Äì ASEAN-10 Inflation Rate Heatmap (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 6](output/charts/Inflation_Heatmap.png)
 This heatmap shows inflation rate fluctuations in ASEAN-10. Myanmar and Laos faced multiple high-inflation periods, while Malaysia and Singapore remained relatively stable.

### Chart 7 ‚Äì Malaysia: Dual-Axis GDP and Inflation Trend (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 7](output/charts/Malaysia_GDP_vs_Inflation.png)
 This chart displays Malaysia‚Äôs annual GDP per capita and inflation rates using a dual-axis view. GDP shows consistent growth, while inflation remains controlled, with noticeable dips during the 2009 crisis and 2020 pandemic.

### Chart 8 ‚Äì Malaysia: Year-on-Year GDP per Capita Growth Rate (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 8](output/charts/Malaysia_Year-on-Year_GDP_per_Capita_Growth_Rate.png)
This chart highlights Malaysia‚Äôs annual per capita GDP growth rate. Major downturns occurred in 2009, 2015, and 2020, but the economy consistently demonstrated strong rebounds afterward.

### Chart 9 ‚Äì Malaysia: GDP vs Inflation (Area Difference, 2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 9](output/charts/Malaysia_GDP_vs_Inflation_(Scaled_Area_Difference).png)
 This area chart compares GDP per capita and inflation (scaled √ó1000), highlighting the ‚Äúgrowth vs inflation gap.‚Äù A wider area suggests stronger real growth and better inflation management.

 To visualize the relative relationship between GDP per capita and Inflation, I linearly magnified the inflation rate by 1000 times to make it visually close to the GDP level, so that a meaningful area difference map can be constructed. A high magnification (such as √ó10000) will cause misleading reversals.

### Chart 10 ‚Äì Malaysia: Inflation Rate Distribution by Decade (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 10](output/charts/Inflation_Rate_Distribution_by_Decade.png)
This boxplot shows Malaysia‚Äôs inflation rate trends across the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. Although the 2020s group includes only a few years, the distribution appears more concentrated, suggesting improved price stability.

##  Conclusion

This project analyzes GDP per capita and inflation trends from 2000 to 2023 using World Bank data, covering global, ASEAN regional, and Malaysia-specific perspectives.

At the global level, GDP and inflation exhibit a moderate negative correlation (Spearman œÅ ‚âà ‚Äì0.40), with low-income countries showing greater inflation volatility.

Regionally, ASEAN countries display uneven development‚ÄîSingapore and Brunei remain high-income, while Myanmar and Laos struggle with inflation instability. Malaysia stands out as a mid-to-high income economy with both growth consistency and monetary stability.

Notably, Malaysia achieved positive GDP-inflation differentials in most years and demonstrated improving price stability, underscoring its maturing macroeconomic management.
