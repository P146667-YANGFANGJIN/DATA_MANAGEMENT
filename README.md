##  Chart Previews

### Chart 1 ‚Äì Global Scatter Plot: GDP vs Inflation (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 1](output/charts/Global_Scatter_Plot_2000-2023.png)

 This chart shows a moderate negative correlation (**Spearman œÅ ‚âà ‚Äì0.40**) between GDP per capita and inflation across countries. The trend is visible but weakened by large inflation volatility in low-income economies.

 
### Chart 2‚Äì World Map: GDP per Capita in 2023
![Chart 2](output/charts/GDP_per_Capita_in_2023.png)

 This choropleth map visualizes GDP per capita in 2023. North America, Western Europe, and parts of East Asia show high income levels, while Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia remain in the low-income range.  

*Map note: The world map is generated using Plotly's built-in geographic base (based on the [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) dataset) and visualized with 2023 GDP per capita data from the World Bank. The map is for data visualization purposes only and does not imply any political stance.*

 ***Note: This map is interactive. The image shown here is a static screenshot. To explore the zoomable and draggable version, please run the corresponding cell in the Notebook.***

 This chart illustrates the per capita income growth of ASEAN-10 countries over two decades. Singapore and Brunei remain clear leaders, while Malaysia shows steady mid-to-high income progression.

### Chart 4‚Äì ASEAN-10: Inflation Rate (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 4](output/charts/ASEAN-10_Inflation_Rate_2000‚Äì2023.png)
 This chart shows inflation trends across ASEAN-10 countries. Singapore and Malaysia maintain low and stable rates, while Myanmar and Laos experience significant volatility.
 
### Chart 5‚Äì ASEAN-10 GDP per Capita Heatmap (2000‚Äì2023)
![Chart 5](output/charts/GDP_Heatmap.png)
